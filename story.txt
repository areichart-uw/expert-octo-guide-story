Once upon a time there was a young man named octo who lived in the village hidden in the trees. He was an expert guide, he knew the complete layout of the forest. Whenever guests came to the village, his neighbors would always ask him to give them tours.
One day a magician came to the village. He found there was something hidden in the forest, so he asked for octo to guide him to the forest. 
Once they arrived to the forest, the magicin asked octo to stay behind. Octo hesitantly agreed, not knowing what was to come.
